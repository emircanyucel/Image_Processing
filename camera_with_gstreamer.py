In this script, we will connect to the camera with gstreamer. Gstreamer is a media processing and streaming framework.
(GStreamer can be used to process, encode, encrypt and distribute audio, video and image data.)

NOTE: If you want to launch camera in linux terminal, you can copy and paste this code to the terminal.

gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw,width=640,height=480,framerate=30/1 ! videoconvert ! autovideosink

You can reach my tutorial content, which I have prepared for a detailed explanation of this, and similar content,
where I share my experience and knowledge, from the link below.
